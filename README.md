# Object Analysis System

## Description
This project develops an integrated system capable of performing object detection, object segmentation, and object classification using advanced machine learning algorithms and neural networks. This system is designed to enhance automated image processing applications by providing detailed and accurate analysis of digital images.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Identify and locate multiple objects within a digital image.
- **Object Segmentation**: Partition images into segments that simplify their representation for easier analysis.
- **Object Classification**: Categorize each detected object into predefined classes.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/object-analysis-system.git
cd object-analysis-system
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage
To run the object detection, use the following command:

python detect_objects.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg



## Technologies Used

```bash
Python 3.8
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV 4.x


## System Requirements

```bash
Operating System: Windows 10 or Ubuntu 20.04
RAM: 8GB or higher
GPU: Optional but recommended for performance (CUDA-compatible GPU)
Results
This section should describe the outcomes of your experiments, including the accuracy and efficiency of detection, segmentation, and classification tasks. Include sample images to illustrate the outputs of the system.
