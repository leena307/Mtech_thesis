# Purpose

## Object Analysis System
The purpose of this thesis is to explore and advance the field of computer vision by investigating the fundamental techniques of object detection, object classification, and object segmentation. These core technologies are pivotal for a wide range of applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and they provide critical capabilities for analyzing visual data.

**Object Detection**: Identify and locate multiple objects within a digital image. This technique is essential for identifying and localizing objects within images or video streams. By accurately detecting objects, we can enable applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and interactive robotics, where precise location and recognition of objects are crucial for functionality and safety.

**Object Classification**: Categorize each detected object into predefined classes. Understanding and categorizing objects is fundamental for enabling systems to interpret visual data. Object classification supports a variety of applications, including content-based image retrieval, quality control in manufacturing, and intelligent image tagging, by allowing systems to assign meaningful labels to objects based on their features.

**Object Segmentation**: Segmentation provides a detailed understanding of the spatial structure of objects within an image. This technique is important for applications requiring fine-grained visual information, such as medical imaging, scene understanding, and augmented reality, where distinguishing the precise boundaries and shapes of objects enhances the accuracy and utility of visual analysis.

Through this thesis, we aim to contribute to the development of more robust and efficient computer vision models, enhancing their ability to perceive, understand, and interact with the visual world. By evaluating and integrating these techniques, the research will address current challenges and propose innovative solutions to improve the performance and application of visual recognition systems.
